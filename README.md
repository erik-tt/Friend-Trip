# About Friend Trip
Friend Trip is a platform for people who want to meet up and go for a trip. It can be anything from a long hike to a casual city walk. You can sign up as a regular user or a commercial user. Regular users can create new trips and see other trips. The commercial users sign up with a company name to show other users that they are commercial. Commercial users are implemented to be able to monitize trips, and to be able to host larger trips. Admin has the privilege to delete all kinds of trips. When commercial trips are implemented can admin delete these as well. 

# Technology Stack
